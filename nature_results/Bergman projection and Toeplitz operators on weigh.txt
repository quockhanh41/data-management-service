DOI: 10.1007/s10473-025-0414-1
Abstract: In this paper, it is shown that the harmonic Bergman projection P _ ω ^ h , induced by a radial weight ω , is bounded and onto from $$L^{\infty}(\mathbb{D})$$ L ∞ ( D ) to the harmonic Bloch space $$\cal{B}_{h}$$ B h - if and only if $$\omega\in \cal{D}$$ ω ∈ D , which is a class of radial weights satisfying the two-sided doubling conditions. As an application, the bounded and compact positive Toeplitz operators T _ μ,ω ^ h on the endpoint case weighted harmonic Bergman space $$L^1_{h,\omega}(\mathbb{D})$$ L h , ω 1 ( D ) are characterized.
